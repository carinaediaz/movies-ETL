# Movies ETL
## Overview
##### We were tasked with preparing the clean datasets that will be used for the Amazing Prime Video's hackathon. We extracted data from different data sources (Wikipedia scrape of all movies released since 1990 and rating data from MovieLens), transformed it into one clean dataset using Python, and loaded that dataset into a SQL database.
